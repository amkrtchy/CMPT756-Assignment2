ASSIGNMENT2



-----------------
INPUT
-----------------
File is run on two images: 
     - small image (~2MB) provided in.ppm provided with the assignment 
     - large image (~200MB) available at http://cmpt-886.sfucloud.ca/in.ppm-70mp.zip
Manually set the filename in the main() function

-----------------
OUTPUT
-----------------
Program ouputs converted images:
	- out_yuv_gpu.yuv & out_rgb_gpu.ppm for the GPU conversion
	- out_yuv_cpu.yuv & out_rgb_cpu.ppm for the CPU conversion (currently commented out, uncomment corresponding code sections to view)

-----------------
THREADS PER BLOCK
-----------------
	Parameter M sets threads per block in our program and is hardcoded. 
	Change it in the rgb2yuvGPU() and yuv2rgbGPU() functions to the desired value



-----------------
COMPILE AND RUN
-----------------	
    - We require cuda 9.1 to compile our program. Change Makefile for different versions. 
    - Compile the program with make
    - Run the program via ./mycode

EXPERIEMT RESULTS
-------------------

***Times to copy image to and from device

   1) Copy image from host to device
      small image: 0.53ms
      large image: 20.98ms

   2) Copy image from host to device and from device to host
      small image:  0.928ms
      large image:  49.12ms

***Time to copy image to device without initial empty kernel launch

   small image: 106.71ms
   large image: 115.81ms


*** Try different threads per blocks M (due to our implementation block sizes are atuomatically extracted to span entire image)
   
   Data for small image (times in ms):

   		M = 1:    RBG->YUV = 15.14, YUV -> RGB = 9.56
   		M = 8:    RGB->YUV = 3.54, YUV -> RGB = 2.96
   		M = 16:   RGB->YUV = 2.78, YUV -> RGB = 2.46

   		M = 1024: RGB->YUV = 2.40, YUV -> RGB = 2.25 
   		M = 1025: No proper processing for image (limit of threads per block is 1024!)

   	Data for large image (times in ms):

   	    M = 1:    RGB->YUV = 1044.69ms, YUV -> RGB = 610.16ms
   	    M = 8:    RGB->YUV = 219.61, YUV -> RGB = 148.10
   	    M = 16:   RGB->YUV = 160.09, YUV -> RGB = 108.24
   	    M = 32:   RGB->YUV = 97.70, YUV -> RGB = 84.93
   	    M = 64:   RGB->YUV = 111.66, YUV -> RGB = 89.18

CPU processing times for small image are RBG->YUV = 31.71ms and YUV->RGB = 11.16ms
CPU processing times for large image are RGB->YUV = 1610.69ms and YUV -> RGB = 1015.02ms
