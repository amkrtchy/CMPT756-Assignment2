-----------------
INPUT
-----------------
File is run on two images: 
     - small image (~2MB) provided in.ppm provided with the assignment 
     - large image (~200MB) available at http://cmpt-886.sfucloud.ca/in.ppm-70mp.zip
Manually set the filename in the main() function

-----------------
OUTPUT
-----------------
Program ouputs converted images:
	- out_yuv_gpu.yuv & out_rgb_gpu.ppm for the GPU conversion
	- out_yuv_cpu.yuv & out_rgb_cpu.ppm for the CPU conversion (currently commented out, uncomment corresponding code sections to view)

-----------------
THREADS PER BLOCK
-----------------
	Parameter M sets threads per block in our program and is hardcoded. 
	Change it in the rgb2yuvGPU() and yuv2rgbGPU() functions to the desired value



-----------------
COMPILE AND RUN
-----------------	
    - We require cuda 9.1 to compile our program. Change Makefile for different versions. 
    - Compile the program with make
    - Run the program via ./mycode
